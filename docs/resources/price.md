## Schema

### Required

- `active` (Boolean) Whether the price can be used for new purchases.
- `description` (String) A brief description of the price.

### Optional

- `billing_duration_amount` (Number) The billing period duration
- `billing_duration_unit` (String) The billing period duration unit. must be one of ["weeks", "months", "years"]
- `is_composite_price` (Boolean) The flag for prices that contain price components.
- `is_tax_inclusive` (Boolean) Specifies whether the price is considered `inclusive` of taxes or not. Default: false
- `long_description` (String) A detailed description of the price. This is shown on the order document and order table. Multi-line supported.
- `notice_time_amount` (Number) The notice period duration
- `notice_time_unit` (String) The notice period duration unit. must be one of ["weeks", "months", "years"]
- `price_components` (Attributes) A set of [price](/api/pricing#tag/simple_price_schema) components that define the composite price. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--price_components))
- `price_display_in_journeys` (String) Defines the way the price amount is display in epilot journeys. must be one of ["show_price", "show_as_starting_price", "show_as_on_request"]
- `pricing_model` (String) Describes how to compute the price per period. Either `per_unit`, `tiered_graduated` or `tiered_volume`.
- `per_unit` indicates that the fixed amount (specified in unit_amount or unit_amount_decimal) will be charged per unit in quantity
- `tiered_graduated` indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using tiers attribute. The customer pays the price per unit in every range their purchase rises through.
- `tiered_volume` indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using tiers attribute. The customer pays the same unit price for all purchased units.
- `tiered_flatfee` While similar to tiered_volume, tiered flat fee charges for the same price (flat) for the entire range instead using the unit price to multiply the quantity.

must be one of ["per_unit", "tiered_volume", "tiered_graduated", "tiered_flatfee"]; Default: "per_unit"
- `renewal_duration_amount` (Number) The renewal period duration
- `renewal_duration_unit` (String) The renewal period duration unit. must be one of ["weeks", "months", "years"]
- `tax` (String) Parsed as JSON.
- `termination_time_amount` (Number) The termination period duration
- `termination_time_unit` (String) The termination period duration unit. must be one of ["weeks", "months", "years"]
- `tiers` (Attributes List) Defines an array of tiers. Each tier has an upper bound, an unit amount and a flat fee. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tiers))
- `type` (String) One of `one_time` or `recurring` depending on whether the price is for a one-time purchase or a recurring (subscription) purchase. must be one of ["one_time", "recurring"]; Default: "one_time"
- `unit` (String) The unit of measurement used for display purposes and possibly for calculations when the price is variable.
- `unit_amount` (Number) The unit amount in cents to be charged, represented as a whole integer if possible.
- `unit_amount_currency` (String) Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase.
- `unit_amount_decimal` (String) The unit amount in cents to be charged, represented as a decimal string with at most 12 decimal places.

### Nested Schema for `price_components`

Optional:

- `dollar_relation` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--price_components--dollar_relation))

<a id="nestedatt--price_components--dollar_relation"></a>
### Nested Schema for `price_components.dollar_relation`

Optional:

- `entity_id` (String) The id of the price component
