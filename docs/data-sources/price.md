- `billing_duration_amount` (Number) The billing period duration
- `billing_duration_unit` (String) The billing period duration unit. must be one of ["weeks", "months", "years"]

- `long_description` (String) A detailed description of the price. This is shown on the order document and order table. Multi-line supported.
- `notice_time_amount` (Number) The notice period duration
- `notice_time_unit` (String) The notice period duration unit. must be one of ["weeks", "months", "years"]
- `price_components` (Attributes) A set of [price](/api/pricing#tag/simple_price_schema) components that define the composite price. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--price_components))
- `price_display_in_journeys` (String) Defines the way the price amount is display in epilot journeys. must be one of ["show_price", "show_as_starting_price", "show_as_on_request"]
- `pricing_model` (String) Describes how to compute the price per period. Either `per_unit`, `tiered_graduated` or `tiered_volume`.
- `per_unit` indicates that the fixed amount (specified in unit_amount or unit_amount_decimal) will be charged per unit in quantity
- `tiered_graduated` indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using tiers attribute. The customer pays the price per unit in every range their purchase rises through.
- `tiered_volume` indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using tiers attribute. The customer pays the same unit price for all purchased units.
- `tiered_flatfee` While similar to tiered_volume, tiered flat fee charges for the same price (flat) for the entire range instead using the unit price to multiply the quantity.

must be one of ["per_unit", "tiered_volume", "tiered_graduated", "tiered_flatfee"]
