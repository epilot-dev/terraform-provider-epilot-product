- `active` (Boolean) Whether the price can be used for new purchases.
- `additional` (Map of String) Additional fields that are not part of the schema
- `billing_duration_amount` (Number) The billing period duration
- `billing_duration_unit` (String) The billing period duration unit. must be one of ["weeks", "months", "years"]
- `created_at` (String)
- `description` (String) A brief description of the price.
- `files` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--files))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `is_composite_price` (Boolean) The flag for prices that contain price components.
- `is_tax_inclusive` (Boolean) Specifies whether the price is considered `inclusive` of taxes or not.

- `price_display_in_journeys` (String) Defines the way the price amount is display in epilot journeys. must be one of ["show_price", "show_as_starting_price", "show_as_on_request"]
- `pricing_model` (String) Describes how to compute the price per period. Either `per_unit`, `tiered_graduated` or `tiered_volume`.
- `per_unit` indicates that the fixed amount (specified in unit_amount or unit_amount_decimal) will be charged per unit in quantity
- `tiered_graduated` indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using tiers attribute. The customer pays the price per unit in every range their purchase rises through.
- `tiered_volume` indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using tiers attribute. The customer pays the same unit price for all purchased units.
- `tiered_flatfee` While similar to tiered_volume, tiered flat fee charges for the same price (flat) for the entire range instead using the unit price to multiply the quantity.

must be one of ["per_unit", "tiered_volume", "tiered_graduated", "tiered_flatfee"]
