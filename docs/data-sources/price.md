```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->

- `active` (Boolean) Whether the price can be used for new purchases.
- `additional` (Map of String) Additional fields that are not part of the schema
- `billing_duration_amount` (Number) The billing period duration
- `billing_duration_unit` (String) The billing period duration unit
- `created_at` (String)
- `description` (String) A brief description of the price.
- `files` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--files))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `is_composite_price` (Boolean) The flag for prices that contain price components.
- `is_tax_inclusive` (Boolean) Specifies whether the price is considered `inclusive` of taxes or not.
- `long_description` (String) A detailed description of the price. This is shown on the order document and order table. Multi-line supported.
- `manifest` (List of String) Manifest ID used to create/update the entity
- `notice_time_amount` (Number) The notice period duration
- `notice_time_unit` (String) The notice period duration unit
- `org` (String) Organization Id the entity belongs to
- `owners` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--owners))
- `price_components` (Attributes) A set of [price](/api/pricing#tag/simple_price_schema) components that define the composite price. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--price_components))
- `price_display_in_journeys` (String) Defines the way the price amount is display in epilot journeys.
- `pricing_model` (String) Describes how to compute the price per period. Either `per_unit`, `tiered_graduated` or `tiered_volume`.
- `per_unit` indicates that the fixed amount (specified in unit_amount or unit_amount_decimal) will be charged per unit in quantity
- `tiered_graduated` indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using tiers attribute. The customer pays the price per unit in every range their purchase rises through.
- `tiered_volume` indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using tiers attribute. The customer pays the same unit price for all purchased units.
- `tiered_flatfee` While similar to tiered_volume, tiered flat fee charges for the same price (flat) for the entire range instead using the unit price to multiply the quantity.
- `purpose` (List of String)
- `renewal_duration_amount` (Number) The renewal period duration
- `renewal_duration_unit` (String) The renewal period duration unit
- `schema` (String)
- `tags` (List of String)

- `title` (String)
- `type` (String) One of `one_time` or `recurring` depending on whether the price is for a one-time purchase or a recurring (subscription) purchase.
- `unit` (String) The unit of measurement used for display purposes and possibly for calculations when the price is variable.
- `unit_amount` (Number) The unit amount in cents to be charged, represented as a whole integer if possible.
- `unit_amount_currency` (String) Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase.
- `unit_amount_decimal` (String) The unit amount in cents to be charged, represented as a decimal string with at most 12 decimal places.
